 conversion rate
  Conversion rates are calculated by simply taking the number of conversions and dividing that by the number of total ad interactions that can be tracked to a conversion during the same time period. For example, if you had 50 conversions from 1,000 interactions, your conversion rate would be 5%, since 50 ÷ 1,000 = 5%.

 Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)
  The simplest formula for measuring customer lifetime value is Customer Lifetime Value = Average Total Order Amount * Average # Purchases Per Year * Retention Rate.
 Retention Rate
  Find out how many customers you have at the end of a given period (week, month, or quarter). Subtract the number of new customers you’ve acquired over that time. Divide by the number of customers you had at the beginning of that period. Then, multiply that by one hundred.

 Average Order Value (AOV)
  To calculate your company's average order value, simply divide total revenue by the number of orders. For example, let's say that in the month of September, your web store's sales were $31,000 and you had a total of 1,000 orders. $31,000 divided by 1,000 = $31, so September's monthly AOV was $31.
